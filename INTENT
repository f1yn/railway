-- INTENT --

But understand it was not built for authoritarians, profiteers, or those who trade in harm.

If you turn this work against people or the planet, I want no part in what you build.

I trust those who build with care. But if you use this work to advance systems of harm, I intently hope it fails when you need it most.

Your intent, regardless of your will - shall find it's way back to you.
